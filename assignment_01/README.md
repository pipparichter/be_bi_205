# Assignment 1: Cell Classification

The `main` function in the `assignment_01.py` file accepts an `X` and `y` loaded directly from the `.npz` files, preprocesses the data, and passes it into the model. It returns a mapping of segmentation mask ids (which I refered to as `cell_number` in my code) to celltype codes.
